      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Arsalan, a computer vision researcher trying to teach machines to see the world in 
        ways humans can't.
        
        I grew up fascinated by flight and earned my aerospace engineering degree (with 
        a gold medal!). But I became even more captivated by how we can use cameras and algorithms 
        to perceive and help machines understand the world which sometimes somethings are invisible to our eyes - from detecting early bruises under apple skin before they're 
        visible, to helping doctors see inside the human body in with AI based medical imaging, to assisting cultural heritage professionals digitize and understand historical artifacts using Computer Vision.
        
        Now I'm completing my PhD across two countries (Norway and France), working on AI systems that 
        capture and model how light interacts with surfaces. My research has taken me from Viking-age 
        textiles in Oslo museums to operating rooms in France, always asking: "How can we make machines 
        see better?"
        
        I love projects where computer vision meets real-world messiness: autonomous robots navigating 
        unknown environments, sensors struggling with weird lighting, defects hiding just below the 
        surface. The gap between "works in the lab" and "works on the runway" is where things get 
        interesting.
        
        Currently I am based in the beautiful 
        small town of Gjøvik in Norway, where I balance PhD thesis writing with padel playing and walking along beautiful lake of Mjøsa.
        
        Always happy to chat about computer vision, robotics, or why hyperspectral/multispectral imaging is cooler 
        than it sounds. Looking forward for new opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects that life will bring to me </p>
